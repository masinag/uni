ps -o pid,ppid,pgid,sid,uid,euid 21256
shows info about process with pid 21256:
	*pid: process id, univocal
	*ppid: parent pid, pid of the process which created this process.
		the root process is called "init". If the parent of a
		process terminated and the process is still running, it is
		adopted by init.
	*pgid: process group id. It identifies a group of processes which can
		interact closely. When a process creates a son, the son 
		inherits the pgid of the parent.
		Every group has a leader and the group is identified by the
		pid of its leader.
	*sid:  session id. A session is a set of groups defined to manage
		its groups. Every group belongs to a session.
		Every session has a leader group and is identified by the
		gid of its leader. A leader cannot leave its group.
	*ruid: real user id. User who runs the process.
	*eiud: execution user id. User with which the process is executed.
		Usually it coincides with ruid. For instance the command 
		passwd is executed as root.
		running ls -alh /usr/bin/passwd you can see it is a special
		command since the file is shown in red.
